// Special IDs:  
// 0 - should not be used normally, sets status to all devices
// 1 - master ID (if this ID is present in the packet - the packet
//  contains all known statuses and should be saved for reference)
// Device may have multiple IDs (if one status is not enough or
// one additional for broadcasting, not just receiving)

// Statuses:
// Higher bit is 0 - see statuses.txt
// Higher bit is 1 - flags-based status (15 lower bits, specific for device)
